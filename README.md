# PRODIGY_ML_03
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based image classification system to distinguish between cat and dog images. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is used for feature extraction, and the model is trained and evaluated using Google Colab on a reduced version of the dataset for efficient execution.
